        <h1>COVID-19</h1>
        <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) <mark style="background-color: pink;"> a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory 
           syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</mark> The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019
           <u>It has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.</u><del>covid 19- doesn't kill you.</del></del></p>
        <div>
        <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often <i><u>include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, 
           and loss of smell and taste.</u></i> <b>Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. Around one
            in five infected individuals do not develop any symptoms.[9] While most people have mild symptoms, some 
            people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS can be precipitated by cytokine storms,
            [10] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.</b> Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the 
            lungs and heart) has been observed. There is concern about a significant number of patients who have 
            recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—known as long 
            COVID—for months afterwards. These effects include severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, 
            low-grade fever, muscle weakness, and breathlessness.</p>

        <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
        <P><mark style="background-color: pink;">Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.[22][23] Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. For example, one person may have a high fever, a cough, and fatigue, and another person may have a low fever at the start of the disease and develop difficulty breathing a week later. However, in people without prior ears, nose, and throat (ENT) disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19 with a specificity of 95%.[24]</mark></P>
        <p>As is common with infections, <u>there is a delay, known as the incubation period</u>, between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median incubation period for COVID-19 is four to five days.[25] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all symptomatic people will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve.[25][26]</p>
        <div>
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p><b>Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[112][113][114][115][116] Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.[117][118]</b></p>
        <p>The first COVID-19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 December by the UK medicines regulator MHRA.[119] It was evaluated for emergency use authorization (EUA) status by the US FDA, and in several other countries.[120] Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID-19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.[121][122] Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the curve".[123] This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.[123][124]</p>
        <h3><U>Vaccine</U></h3>
        <P><mark style="background-color: pink;"> COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against COVID-19. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, work to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus diseases SARS and MERS had established knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses, which accelerated development during early 2020 of varied technology platforms for a COVID‑19 vaccine.</mark></P>
        <p>By December, more than 10 billion vaccine doses had been preordered by countries,[148] with about half of the doses purchased by high-income countries comprising only 14% of the world's population.[149] The manufacturers of three vaccines closest to global distribution – Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca – predicted a manufacturing capacity of 5.3 billion doses in 2021, which could be used to vaccinate about 3 billion people (as the vaccines require two doses for a protective effect against COVID-19). Due to the high demand of preorders in 2020–21,[149] people in low-income developing countries may not receive vaccinations from these manufacturers until 2023 or 2024, increasing the need for the global COVAX initiative to supply vaccines equitably.</p>
        <h3><u>Social Distancing</u></h3>
        <p><u>Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[150] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.</u> Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic.[151] Initial recommendations included maintaining a six-foot/two-meter distance from others outside the family unit. However, a case occurring in South Korea suggested that is inadequate, citing transmission despite a brief exposure (5 minutes) at 20 feet from the carrier in a restaurant.[152] In a study reviewing the spread of Cornavirus at a restaurant on January 24, Chinese New Year, researchers found among 21 diners at three adjacent tables, 10 had contracted the disease from the index patient, the furthest seated 4.6 meters/15 feet, away from the spreader. Indoor air currents facilitated the contagion.[153] The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10. A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic. The best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, however, as local conditions vary.[150]</p>

        <p><blockquote>COVID-19: How to Be Physically Active While Social Distancing. This depends on how old your child is, and ranges from being active throughout the day for preschool-aged children (ages 3 through 5 years) to being active for 60 minutes or more for school-aged children and adolescents (ages 6 through 17 years). This may sound like a lot, but don’t worry! Your child may already be meeting the recommended physical activity levels. And, you’ll soon discover all the easy and enjoyable ways to help your child meet the recommendations. Encourage your child to participate in activities that are age-appropriate, enjoyable, and offer variety!</blockquote></p><br>

                    suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
                    The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
                    Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
                    thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were
                    both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple
                    cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes
                    were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose
                    was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This
                    man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.

                    on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was
                    vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill,
                    and — a letter for Harry.Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic
                    band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had
                    no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never
                    even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed
                    so plainly there could be no mistake:</td>

                    the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
                    Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.
                    “But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?”
                    “Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill
                    you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see . . . he

                    no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.”
                    Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but
                    Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a
                    horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his
                    life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon;</td>

                    Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax
                    seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake
                    surrounding a large letter H.</td>

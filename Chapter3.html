                    cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and
                    ran from the room.

                    did have were Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing

                    and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not
                    wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman
                    eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
